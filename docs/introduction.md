# Overview

WPBakery Page Builder (formerly Visual Composer) is a powerful drag-and-drop WordPress plugin that allows users to build complex layouts with ease.

While it provides a visual interface for users, developers can extend its functionality by registering custom elements, integrating custom controls, and tweaking rendering logic on both backend and frontend.
